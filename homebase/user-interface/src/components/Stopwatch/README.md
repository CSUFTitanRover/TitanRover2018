```js
<Stopwatch />
```

Pressing start will begin keeping track of the passage of time.  Pressing it again will pause the time.  Clear will reset the counter to zero.  Using the DeepstreamStopwatch component will synchronize this component to the deepstream stopwatch state.  Any other devices/windows connected to the deepstream server will be synchrionized.
